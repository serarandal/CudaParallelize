# CudaParallelize
This is my attempt to paralellize different operations using CUDA.<br/>
The first try was mulMatriz in which I multiply two matrix.<br/>
After that I was able to optimize it, the outcome was mulMatrizOpt.<br/>
Reading about parallelize and parallel applications, I found that the mandelbrot is always a good way to learn about it, so mandelpar was born.<br/>
The bitonicPar is the paralellize counterpart of the bitonic sort algorithm.<br/>
