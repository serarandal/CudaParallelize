# CudaParallelize
This is my attempt to paralellize different operations using CUDA.<br/>
The first try was mulMatriz in which I multiply two matrix.<br/>
After that I was able to optimize it, the outcome was mulMatrizOpt.<br/>
Reading about parallelize and parallel applications, I found that the mandelbrot is always a good way to learn about it, so mandelpar was born.<br/>
The bitonicPar is the paralellize counterpart of the bitonic sort algorithm.<br/>

## Installation and requisites
You need an nvidia graphics card that is capable of running CUDA.
when we learnt about CUDA, we followed this [guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/) to install it on linux.
