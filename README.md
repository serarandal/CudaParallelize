# CudaParallelize
This is my attempt to paralellize different operations using CUDA
The first try was mulMatriz in which I multiply two matrix.
After that I was able to optimize it, the outcome was mulMatrizOpt.
Reading about parallelize and parallel applications, I found that the mandelbrot is always a good way to learn about it, so mandelpar was born.
The bitonicPar is the paralellize counterpart of the bitonic sort algorithm.
